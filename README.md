# Israel vaccinated-verified-by-age data collector

This GitHub repo captures the vaccinated-verified-by-age data from [datadashboard.health.gov.il](https://datadashboard.health.gov.il/COVID-19/general) twice per day.

The [`vaccinated-verified-by-age.csv`](./vaccinated-verified-by-age.csv) file gets updated as part of the capture.

Data for 2021-08-11 through 2021-08-18 were manually scraped as XSLX files thanks to Oded and the XLSX files are missing three columns (which could be inferred from the ratio of normalized to amount)
